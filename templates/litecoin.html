        The earliest known appearance of the phrase is from The Boston Journal.
        In an article titled "Current Notes" in the February 10, 1885, morning
        edition, the phrase is mentioned as a good practice sentence for writing
        students: "A favorite copy set by writing teachers for their pupils is
        the following, because it contains every letter of the alphabet: 'A
        quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"[1] Dozens of other newspapers
        published the phrase over the next few months, all using the version of
        the sentence starting with "A" rather than "The".[2] The earliest known
        use of the phrase in its modern form (starting with "The") is from the
        1888 book Illustrative Shorthand by Linda Bronson.[3] The modern form
        (starting with "The") became more common despite the fact that it is
        slightly longer than the original (starting with "A").
